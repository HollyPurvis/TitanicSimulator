This program uses a Titanic dataset to predict the likelihood of survival based on user input. You can either input personal characteristics (age, sex, and class) to estimate your chance of survival or choose to view a generated graph showing the survival distribution based on these attributes.

Features:

Survival Prediction: The program will prompt the user to input their age, sex, and class, and then calculate their likelihood of surviving based on these factors.

Data Visualization: Users can view a graph that visualizes the relationship between passenger characteristics (age, sex, and class) and survival rates.
